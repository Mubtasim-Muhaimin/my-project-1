	<h1>hello world</h1>
	<h2>In the land of Echoing Domes, where thoughts bounce like rubber ducks on marble floors, the sky hums in hexadecimal and the trees whisper in Morse code. Beneath the third dome, a council of sentient spoons debates the ethics of soup. Time is measured in sideways glances and the currency is compliments traded in jars of moonlight.A pigeon named Harold runs the weather, toggling between drizzle and existential dread. Meanwhile, the ground occasionally forgets it’s supposed to be solid, and dreams of becoming a trampoline. Everyone wears hats made of forgotten memories, and the local sport involves juggling metaphors while riding unicycles made of doubt.Welcome to Domeville. Please check your logic at the door.</h2>

	<p>Step right up and witness the marvels of the pixel parade! From juggling buttons to trapeze-scrolling menus, every element dances with delight. The lion roars in bold font while the clown tiptoes across margins. Don't blink—this layout flips, twists, and somersaults into your imagination.</p>
